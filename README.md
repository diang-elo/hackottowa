Inspiration

Our inspiration for the website was Discord. Seeing how that software could bring gamers together. We decided we we wanted to do the same thing but with with coworkers, and friends giving them a place where people can relax and have a laugh with people during their free time from work, especially with the pandemic affecting mental health. To bring as many people together to de-stress was our goal.

What it does

RELIEF is a place for you to take a step back, relax, and collect yourself before getting back into your daily routine. RELIEF has many different ways to help you de-stress, whether your stress is caused by individual, organizational, or environmental factors, we definitely have a way to help you! RELEIF has multiple stress relief options including meditation, gameplay, and an interactive chatroom.

How we built it

We built it using react with firebase.

Challenges we ran into

We are all fairly new to web development so we were learning everything on the fly. Getting things in the desired position on the website was a challenge. As well as making the website looks as intended on different screen sizes.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of the final submitted product. The simple chic look gives our website the intended relaxing, stress free environment. We are proud of how much we accomplished with how little knowledge we had to begin with.

What we learned

We learned that there's a bunch of resources outside of school that teaches you how to code things (YouTube) We learned our productivity level sky rocketed while participating in the hackathon. We learned that even in isolation there are still people willing to share their wisdom despite not know who we are, it gives us the motivation to eventually do what the mentor, organizers, and sponsors are doing.

What's next for RELIEF

We are focusing on developing a mobile app just like how we had it Adding multiple single player and multi player games for users to enjoy. Adding more functionality to the chat. Adding more music to the meditation room with a more interactive interface.
